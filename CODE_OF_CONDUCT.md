# TresProh Code of Conduct

## Rules

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

1. Repeated Trolling or Malicious contributions (in any form).
2. Publishing others' private information without permission, otherwise known as
   doxing.
3. Anything illegal in the real world.
4. Being anti-social (it's general I know, but use common-sense).
4. Talking about real-world politics (if in objectively inoffensive ways, it's fine).

## Administrator and Moderator Conduct

Moderators and Administrators have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned 
to this Code of Conduct. As well as temporarily or permanently ban perpetrators.

Everyone gets two chances (in the form of an increasingly longer temporary ban), and
then they're permeantly banned, exceptions sometimes. Banned people can always
appeal it through our email. If you're an overall hinderance to the project and not
reformed, then you'll probably get rejected.
